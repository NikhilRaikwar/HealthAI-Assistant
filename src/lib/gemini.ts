2. Analyze all visible anatomical structures and abnormalities
3. Identify any pathological findings, fractures, masses, or irregularities
4. Assess the severity and clinical significance of findings
5. Provide differential diagnosis based on visible findings
6. Highlight any critical findings requiring immediate attention
7. Consider the patient context if provided
8. Suggest appropriate follow-up imaging or consultations
9. Always err on the side of caution for patient safety
10. Be specific about urgency levels and timeframes
